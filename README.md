# 🌲 Mystic Forest

**Mystic Forest** is a text-based Python adventure game designed as a learning project to explore game mechanics, storytelling, and modular code architecture.

This project is in **active development**, evolving from a simple terminal-based game into a more complex and interactive experience using `pygame`.
